This is a Command Line Iterface (CLI) for administrators of Fabric networks. It is based on the byfn.sh script of the fabric-samples repository, but has other goals and functionalities. It is intended to deploy and configure the network and not to test an end-to-end scenario. Functionalities include creating channel-artefacts, joining a peer to a specific channel, installing Chaincode and instantiating Chaincode.
